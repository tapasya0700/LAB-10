# LAB-10
My Two Data Sets for this LAB-10 machine learning Task
### DataSet1:  Financial_debt
DataSet  Reference Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/eligibility-prediction-for-loan
### Reason for choosing the dataset: The dataset "Financial_debt" can be used in a variety of machine learning issues, particularly in the finance and banking industries. The dataset includes important loan application data such as the applicant's financial information (ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome), credit history (Credit_History, loan amount (LoanAmount), demographics (Gender, Married, Dependents) and loan approval status (Loan_Status). Because these characteristics are crucial in assessing whether a loan application should be allowed or rejected, they make it an intriguing dataset for classification tasks. The dataset provides several analysis options. Gender, marital status, educational attainment, and geographic location can all be utilized to examine loan approval distribution. Financial organizations can make better lending decisions by better understanding the factors that influence loan acceptance or rejection. Examining the correlations between the variables ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount, CoapplicantIncome, and Loan_Amount_Term may reveal patterns affecting loan eligibility.
### DataSet2: Smartphones_reasearch
DataSet  Reference Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhijitdahatonde/real-world-smartphones-dataset
### Reason for choosing dataset: The dataset "Smartphones_research" includes various attributes such as model, price, avg_rating,processor_speed, battery_capacity brand_name,5G_or_not, processor_brand, num_cores, internal_memory, screen_size, fast_charging_available, fast_charging, extended_memory_available, resolution_height, and resolution_width ram_capacity,refresh_rate, num_rear_cameras, os, primary_camera_rear, primary_camera_front, extended_memory_available, resolution_height, and resolution_width.This "dataset" is very useful in machine learning applications such as smartphone analysis and recommendation systems. The collection includes specific details on many smartphone models, such as brand, price, CPU specifications, camera configurations, battery size, 5G capability, and other technical elements. These features give useful data for estimating smartphone costs, gauging user satisfaction, and even advising consumers on smartphone purchases depending on their needs and preferences.
